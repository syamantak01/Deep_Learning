# Name Classification with RNN
[**data**](https://github.com/syamantak01/Deep_Learning/tree/main/Name_Classification_RNN/data) folder contains the data on which the model is trained. Each text file is of the format <_language.txt>
and contains the names in a language of the filename. Eg: ['Chinese.txt'](https://github.com/syamantak01/Deep_Learning/blob/main/Name_Classification_RNN/data/Chinese.txt) contain the names of chinese people.\
Built a Recurrent Neural Network from scratch and used it to classify names. Used fully connected layers as hidden layers in the RNN architecture. The model is not 'State of the art RNN model' but rather 
shows how a RNN model is built from scratch.
